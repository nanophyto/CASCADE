@article{daniels2016,
   abstract = {? The authors 2016.Through the production and export of their calcite coccoliths, coccolithophores form a key component of the global carbon cycle. Despite this key role, very little is known about the biogeochemical role of different coccolithophore species in terms of calcite production, and how these species will respond to future climate change and ocean acidification. Here, we present the first study to estimate species-specific calcite production, from samples collected in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic Iceland Basin in June 2012. We show that although the coccolithophorid Coccolithus pelagicus comprised only a small fraction of the total community in terms of abundance (2%), our estimates indicate that it was the major calcite producer in the Arctic Ocean and Iceland Basin (57% of total calcite production). In contrast, Emiliania huxleyi formed 27% of the total abundance and was responsible for only 20% of the calcite production. That C. pelagicus was able to dominate calcite production was due to its relatively high cellular calcite content compared with the other species present. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the importance of investigating the complete coccolithophore community when considering pelagic calcite production, as relatively rare but heavily calcified species such as C. pelagicus can be the key calcite producers in mixed communities. Therefore, the response of C. pelagicus to ocean acidification and climate change has the potential to have a major impact on carbon cycling within the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean.},

   abstract = {Several coccolithophore species are known to exhibit heteromorphic life cycles. In certain species, notably Emiliania huxleyi, the heterococcolith- bearing phase alternates with a non-calcifying stage, whereas in others the heterococcolith-bearing phase alternates with a holococcolith-bearing phase. Heterococcolithophore-holococcolithophore life cycles have previously been observed for only one species in culture, but have also been inferred from an increasing number of observations of combination coccospheres. 18S rDNA sequences from pure cultures of both the heterococcolith-bearing and holococcolith-bearing phases of Coccolithus pelagicus were identical, providing an additional indication of their identity as different life cycle stages of the same species. Flow cytometric analyses have been undertaken on SybrGreen-stained nuclei isolated from pure cultures of the two phases of four coccolithophore species (Coccolithus pelagicus, Calcidiscus leptoporus, Coronosphaera mediterranea and Emiliania huxleyi) in order to determine relative DNA content. Results confirm the hypothesis that holococcolithophore- heterococcolithophore life cycles are haplo-diploid in nature. Light microscope observations of the processes of sexual fusion and meiosis are reported for two of the experimental species. The results are discussed in the context of the evolution of biomineralization in the coccolithophores and the possible ubiquity of haplo-diploidy in the haptophytes. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

 abstract={Coccolithophores, a diverse group of phytoplankton, make important contributions to pelagic calcite production and export, yet the comparative biogeochemical role of species other than the ubiquitous Emiliania huxleyi is poorly understood. Here we examined the relative importance of E. huxleyi and two Coccolithus species (Coccolithus pelagicus and Coccolithus braarudii), in terms of daily calcite production, by culturing E. huxleyi and Coccolithus in parallel, and comparing growth rates and biometrically determined cellular carbon calcite quotas. Biometric measurements of Coccolithus species, and E. huxleyi cell diameters, were performed using polarised light microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was used for all other biometric measurements of E. huxleyi.},

   abstract = {Coccolithophores are an abundant phytoplankton group that exhibit remarkable diversity in their biology, ecology and calcitic exoskeletons (coccospheres). Their extensive fossil record is a testament to their important biogeochemical role and is a valuable archive of biotic responses to environmental change stretching back over 200 million years. However, to realise the full potential of this archive for (palaeo-)biology and biogeochemistry requires an understanding of the physiological processes that underpin coccosphere architecture. Using culturing experiments on four modern coccolithophore species (Calcidiscus leptoporus, Calcidiscus quadriperforatus, Helicosphaera carteri and Coccolithus braarudii) from three long-lived families, we investigate how coccosphere architecture responds to shifts from exponential (rapid cell division) to stationary (slowed cell division) growth phases as cell physiology reacts to nutrient depletion. These experiments reveal statistical differences in coccosphere size and the number of coccoliths per cell between these two growth phases, specifically that cells in exponential-phase growth are typically smaller with fewer coccoliths, whereas cells experiencing growth-limiting nutrient depletion have larger coccosphere sizes and greater numbers of coccoliths per cell. Although the exact numbers are species-specific, these growth-phase shifts in coccosphere geometry demonstrate that the core physiological responses of cells to nutrient depletion result in increased coccosphere sizes and coccoliths per cell across four different coccolithophore families (Calcidiscaceae, Coccolithaceae, Isochrysidaceae and Helicosphaeraceae), a representative diversity of this phytoplankton group. Building on this, the direct comparison of coccosphere geometries in modern and fossil coccolithophores enables a proxy for growth phase to be developed that can be used to investigate growth responses to environmental change throughout their long evolutionary history. Our data also show that changes in growth rate and coccoliths per cell associated with growth-phase shifts can substantially alter cellular calcite production. Coccosphere geometry is therefore a valuable tool for accessing growth information in the fossil record, providing unprecedented insights into the response of species to environmental change and the potential biogeochemical consequences.},

   abstract = {There exists a great need to better understand the controls on organic carbon sequestration to the deep sea, by virtue of its role in modulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Recent studies suggest that organic fluxes to the oceanic interior are higher in regions dominated by carbonate sedimentation, thus also concluding that relatively heavy carbonate particles are an effective mineral ballast for organic carbon. CaCO3 production in the pelagic ocean is mainly mediated by foraminifera and coccolithophores, but the precise role of these carbonate producers as mineral ballast for organic carbon in the ocean has not yet been tested. Here we evaluate sediment-trap flux data from an array of 13 moorings (15 traps) situated in diverse conditions and with global coverage, all for organic carbon flux, calculated coccolith-carbonate flux, and fine fraction flux (when available). Discrepancies are recorded between the amount of carbonate fine fraction and calculated coccolith carbonate, and there is the need to determine the origin of the unknown CaCO3 in the fine fraction. The coccolith-carbonate flux magnitude is determined not only by the coccolith flux number but also by the carbonate mass of the key species. For example, very abundant coccolithophore species such as Emiliania huxleyi have a very low species-specific carbonate mass, and are therefore of lower carbonate flux significance than expected intuitively. Among the main coccolith carbonate species contributors in our sediment-trap sites are Calcidiscus leptoporus and Helicosphaera carteri, in that these are all relatively massive compared to their numerical abundances. We observed generally positive correlations between calculated coccolith carbonate and organic carbon daily fluxes, suggesting that on a global basis there is a ballasting mechanism at work, seemingly most efficiently with C. leptoporus in the carbonate-dominated North Atlantic. A fairly constant global relationship between annual fluxes of calculated coccolith carbonate and organic carbon implies some uniformity in the PIC/POC "rain ratio". However, improvements in coccolith carbonate estimation are needed to not only understand this ratio currently, but also to help understand future sequestration of organic carbon to the oceanic interior. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {To investigate the role of ballasting by biogenic minerals in the export of organic matter in the ocean, a laboratory experiment was conducted comparing aggregate formation and settling velocity of non-calcifying and calcifying strains of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi. Experiments were conducted by making aggregates using a roller table and following aggregate properties during incubation for a period of 40 days. Size, shape, and settling velocities of aggregates were described by image analysis of video pictures recorded during the roller tank incubation. Our results show that biogenic calcite has a strong effect on the formation rate and abundance of aggregates and on aggregate properties such as size, excess density, porosity, and settling velocity. Aggregates of calcifying cells (AGGCAL) formed faster, were smaller and had higher settling velocities, excess densities, and mass than those of non-calcifying cells (AGGNCAL). AGGCAL showed no loss during the duration of the experiment, whereas AGGNCAL decreased in size after 1 month of incubation. Potential mechanisms that can explain the different patterns in aggregate formation are discussed. Comparison of settling velocities of AGGCAL and AGGNCAL with aggregates formed by diatoms furthermore indicated that the ballast effect of calcite is greater than that of opal. Together these results help to better understand why calcite is of major importance for organic matter fluxes to the deep ocean. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The LOSCAR model is designed to efficiently compute the partitioning of carbon between ocean, atmo- sphere, and sediments on time scales ranging from centuries to millions of years. While a variety of computationally inex- pensive carbon cycle models are already available, many are missing a critical sediment component, which is indispens- able for long-term integrations. One of LOSCAR’s strengths is the coupling of ocean-atmosphere routines to a compu- tationally efficient sediment module. This allows, for in- stance, adequate computation of CaCO3 dissolution, calcite compensation, and long-term carbon cycle fluxes, includ- ing weathering of carbonate and silicate rocks. The ocean component includes various biogeochemical tracers such as total carbon, alkalinity, phosphate, oxygen, and stable car- bon isotopes. LOSCAR’s configuration of ocean geometry is flexible and allows for easy switching between modern and paleo-versions. We have previously published applications of the model tackling future projections of ocean chemistry and weathering, pCO2 sensitivity to carbon cycle perturba- tions throughout the Cenozoic, and carbon/calcium cycling during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. The fo- cus of the present contribution is the detailed description of the model including numerical architecture, processes and parameterizations, tuning, and examples of input and out- put. Typical CPU integration times of LOSCAR are of order seconds for several thousand model years on current stan- dard desktop machines.

   abstract = {Recent measurements of surface coccolithophore calcification from the Atlantic Ocean (50°N-50°S) are compared to similar measurements from other oceanic settings. By combining the different data sets of surface measurements, we examine general and regional patterns of calcification relative to organic carbon production (photosynthesis) and other characteristics of the phytoplankton community. Generally, surface calcification and photosynthesis are positively correlated, although the strength of the relationship differs between biogeochemical provinces. Relationships between surface calcification, chlorophyll-a and calcite concentrations are also statistically significant, although again there is considerable regional variability. Such variability appears unrelated to phytoplankton community composition or hydrographic conditions, and may instead reflect variations in coccolithophore physiology. The contribution of inorganic carbon fixation (calcification) to total carbon fixation (calcification plus photosynthesis) is ∼1-10%, and we estimate a similar contribution from coccolithophores to total organic carbon fixation. However, these contributions vary between biogeochemical provinces, and occasionally coccolithophores may account for >20% of total carbon fixation in unproductive central subtropical gyres. Combining surface calcification and photosynthetic rates with standing stocks of calcite, particulate organic carbon, and estimated phytoplankton carbon allows us to examine the fates of these three carbon pools. The relative turnover times vary between different biogeochemical provinces, with no clear relationship to the overall productivity or phytoplankton community structure found in each province. Rather, interaction between coccolithophore physiology (coccolith production and detachment rates), species diversity (cell size), and food web dynamics (grazer ecology) may control the composition and turnover times of calcite particles in the upper ocean. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Coccolithophore blooms are significant contributors to the global production and export of calcium carbonate (calcite). The Patagonian Shelf is a site of intense annual coccolithophore blooms during austral summer. During December 2008, we made intensive measurements of the ecology, biogeochemistry, and physiology of a coccolithophore bloom. High numbers of Emiliania huxleyi cells and detached coccoliths (>1 × 103 mL−1 and >10 × 103 mL−1, respectively), high particulate inorganic carbon concentrations (>10 mmol C m−2), and high calcite production (up to 7.3 mmol C m−2 d−1) all characterized bloom waters. The bloom was dominated by the low-calcite-containing B/C morphotype of Emiliania huxleyi, although a small (<10 µm) Southern Ocean diatom of the genus Fragilariopsis was present in almost equal numbers (0.2–2 × 103 mL−1). Estimates of Fragilariopsis contributions to chlorophyll, phytoplankton carbon, and primary production were >30%, similar to estimates for E. huxleyi and indicative of a significant role for this diatom in bloom biogeochemistry. Cell-normalized calcification rates, when corrected for a high number of nonactive cells, were relatively high and when normalized to estimates of coccolith calcite indicate excessive coccolith production in the declining phase of the bloom. We find that low measures of calcite and calcite production relative to other blooms in the global ocean indicate that the dominance of the B/C morphotype may lead to overall lower calcite production. Globally, this suggests that morphotype composition influences regional bloom inventories of carbonate production and export and that climate-induced changes in morphotype biogeography could affect the carbon cycle.},

   abstract = {Coccolithophores are a group of calcifying unicellular algae that constitute a major fraction of oceanic primary productivity, play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and are key biostratigraphic marker fossils. Their taxonomy is primarily based on the morphology of the minute calcite plates, or coccoliths, covering the cell. These are diverse and include widespread fine scale variation, of which the biological/taxonomic significance is unknown. Do they represent phenotypic plasticity, genetic polymorphisms, or species-specific characters? Our research on five commonly occurring coccolithophores supports the hypothesis that such variation represents pseudocryptic speciation events, occurring between 0.3 and 12.9 million years ago from a molecular clock estimation. This finding suggests strong stabilizing selection acting on coccolithophorid phenotypes. Our results also provide strong support for the use of fine scale morphological characters of coccoliths in the fossil record to improve biostratigraphic resolution and paleoceanographic data retrieval.},

   abstract = {Coccolithophore species composition was determined in 199 samples collected from the upper 300 m of the Atlantic Ocean, spanning temperate, tropical and subtropical waters in both hemispheres during four Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruises over the period 2003–2005. Of the 171 taxa observed, 140 consistently represented <5% of total cell numbers, and were classed as rare. Multivariate statistical techniques were used on the common taxa to assess variability in community composition vertically in the water column, horizontally across hydrographic provinces (subtropical gyres, equatorial waters, temperate waters), and temporally between cruises. Sharper gradients of statistical dissimilarity in species composition occurred vertically over a few tens of metres than horizontally over hundreds of kilometres. Three floral groups were identified from analysis of the depth of normalised abundance maxima in the subtropical gyres and equatorial waters: the upper euphotic zone (UEZ, >10% surface irradiance); the lower euphotic zone (LEZ, 10–1% surface irradiance); and the sub-euphotic zone (SEZ, <1% surface irradiance). The LEZ includes the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) and nutricline, and was characterised by species such as Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii which were also abundant at higher latitudes. It is suggested that this pattern reflects similarities in the light (and inorganic nutrient) conditions between the LEZ and temperate waters. The SEZ is below the depth where light is thought to be sufficient to support photosynthesis, suggesting that deep-dwelling species such as Florisphaera profunda and Gladiolithus spp. may be mixotrophic or phagotrophic, although conclusive proof will need to be gained experimentally. Mixotrophy could also be an important nutritional strategy for species abundant (Umbellosphaera spp., holococcolithophores) in the UEZ where inorganic nutrient concentrations are depleted and limiting to growth, although other nutritional strategies, such as the use of organic nutrients, are also possible. Statistical differences were also found in the species composition between the different cruises, with high levels of similarity for similar timed cruises (May or September–October). Few individual taxa showed significant variability in abundance over the time-span of sampling, except species such as E. huxleyi and G. ericsonii at higher latitudes. In subtropical and equatorial waters, high levels of species richness and low levels of species dominance remained throughout the sampling period indicating that seasonal fluctuations reflected differences in the whole coccolithophore community rather than in just one or a few species. Multivariate analyses of the taxa classified as rare also indicated some level of temporal, as well as vertical, zonation. Such insights into coccolithophore ecology and community composition provide important new perspectives that require innovative research to fully understand their impact on ocean biogeochemistry.},

Growth rate, particulate organic carbon content, and particulate inorganic carbon content were measured, and organic and inorganic carbon production calculated. The four strains did not show a uniform response to carbonate chemistry changes in any of the analysed parameters and none of the four strains displayed a response pattern previously described for this species. We conclude that the sensitivity of different strains of E. huxleyi to acidification differs substantially and that this likely has a genetic basis.

   abstract = {<p>The Mediterranean Sea is considered a "hot spot" for climate change, being characterized by oligotrophic to ultra-oligotrophic waters and rapidly increasing seasurface temperature and changing carbonate chemistry. Coccolithophores are considered a dominant phytoplankton group in these waters. As marine calcifying organisms they are expected to respond to the ongoing changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. We provide here a description of the springtime coccolithophore distribution in the Mediterranean Sea and relate this to a broad set of in situ-measured environmental variables. Samples were taken during the R/V <i>Meteor</i> (M84/3) oceanographic cruise in April 2011, between 0 and 100 m water depth from 28 stations. Total diatom and silicoflagellate cell concentrations are also presented. Our results highlight the importance of seawater carbonate chemistry, especially [CO<subs>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>] but also [PO<subs>4</sub><sup>3&minus;</sup>] in unraveling the distribution of heterococcolithophores, the most abundant coccolithophore life phase. Holo- and heterococcolithophores respond differently to environmental factors. For instance, changes in heterococcolithophore assemblages were best linked to the combination of [CO<subs>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>], pH, and salinity (&rho; = 0.57), although salinity might be not functionally related to coccolithophore assemblage distribution. Holococcolithophores, on the other hand, showed higher abundances and species diversity in oligotrophic areas (best fit, &rho; = 0.32 for nutrients), thriving in nutrient-depleted waters. Clustering of heterococcolithophores revealed three groups of species sharing more than 65% similarities. These clusters could be assigned to the eastern and western basins and deeper layers (below 50 m), respectively. In addition, the species <i>Gephyrocapsa oceanica</i>, <i>G. muellerae</i>, and <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> morphotype B/C are spatially distributed together and trace the influx of Atlantic waters into the Mediterranean Sea. The results of the present work emphasize the importance of considering holo- and heterococcolithophores separately when analyzing changes in species assemblages and diversity. Our findings suggest that coccolithophores are a main phytoplankton group in the entire Mediterranean Sea and can dominate over siliceous phytoplankton. They have life stages that are expected to respond differently to the variability in seawater carbonate chemistry and nutrient concentrations.</p>},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: The effects of elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and temperature on the cocco­lithophore Syracosphaera pulchra were investigated in isolation and in combination. Both the diploid and the haploid life stages were studied. Batch cultures were grown under 4 conditions: 400 µatm and 19°C; 400 µatm and 22°C; 740 µatm and 19°C; and 740 µatm and 22°C. The growth rate (μ) ­significantly increased under elevated pCO2 only in the haploid stage and showed a different pattern with respect to temperature: it was higher at an elevated temperature in the haploid stage at 400 µatm whereas it decreased in the diploid stage at 740 µatm. Increasing both parameters together increased the growth rate by 11% in the haploid stage only. Elevated pCO2 had a negative impact on the content of particulate organic carbon (POC), production and cell size in both life stages at 19°C, while no significant effect was observed at 22°C. Increasing temperature significantly increased the content of POC and production in the diploid stage at 740 µatm, while at 400 µatm it significantly decreased both the content of POC and production in the haploid stage. A simultaneous increase in pCO2 and temperature had a negative effect on the content of POC and production in the haploid stage only. Neither the rate of calcification (production of particulate inorganic carbon, PIC) nor the PIC:POC ratio were significantly affected by elevated pCO2, temperature or their interaction. These results showed a strong interactive effect between pCO2 and temperature in affecting the physiology of S. pulchra, an effect that was often more pronounced in the haploid life stage. Elevated pCO2 had a stronger effect than temperature.},

   abstract = {Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations are expected to impact pelagic ecosystem functioning in the near future by driving ocean warming and acidification. While numerous studies have investigated impacts of rising temperature and seawater acidification on planktonic organisms separately, little is presently known on their combined effects. To test for possible synergistic effects we exposed two coccolithophore species, Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica, to a CO2 gradient ranging from ∼0.5-250 μmol kg-1 (i.e. ∼20-6000 μatm pCO2) at three different temperatures (i.e. 10, 15, 20°C for E. huxleyi and 15, 20, 25°C for G. oceanica). Both species showed CO2-dependent optimum-curve responses for growth, photosynthesis and calcification rates at all temperatures. Increased temperature generally enhanced growth and production rates and modified sensitivities of metabolic processes to increasing CO 2. CO2 optimum concentrations for growth, calcification, and organic carbon fixation rates were only marginally influenced from low to intermediate temperatures. However, there was a clear optimum shift towards higher CO2 concentrations from intermediate to high temperatures in both species. Our results demonstrate that the CO2 concentration where optimum growth, calcification and carbon fixation rates occur is modulated by temperature. Thus, the response of a coccolithophore strain to ocean acidification at a given temperature can be negative, neutral or positive depending on that strain's temperature optimum. This emphasizes that the cellular responses of coccolithophores to ocean acidification can only be judged accurately when interpreted in the proper eco-physiological context of a given strain or species. Addressing the synergistic effects of changing carbonate chemistry and temperature is an essential step when assessing the success of coccolithophores in the future ocean. © 2014 Sett et al.},

   abstract = {Coccolithophores are globally important marine calcifying phytoplankton that utilize a haplo-diplontic life cycle. The haplo-diplontic life cycle allows coccolithophores to divide in both life cycle phases and potentially expands coccolithophore niche volume. Research has, however, to date largely overlooked the life cycle of coccolithophores and has instead focused on the diploid life cycle phase of coccolithophores. Through the synthesis and analysis of global scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coccolithophore abundance data (n=2534), we find that calcified haploid coccolithophores generally constitute a minor component of the total coccolithophore abundance (≈ 2 %-15 % depending on season). However, using case studies in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, we show that, depending on environmental conditions, calcifying haploid coccolithophores can be significant contributors to the coccolithophore standing stock (up to ≈30 %). Furthermore, using hypervolumes to quantify the niche of coccolithophores, we illustrate that the haploid and diploid life cycle phases inhabit contrasting niches and that on average this allows coccolithophores to expand their niche by ≈18.8 %, with a range of 3 %-76 % for individual species. Our results highlight that future coccolithophore research should consider both life cycle stages, as omission of the haploid life cycle phase in current research limits our understanding of coccolithophore ecology. Our results furthermore suggest a different response to nutrient limitation and stratification, which may be of relevance for further climate scenarios. Our compilation highlights the spatial and temporal sparsity of SEM measurements and the need for new molecular techniques to identify uncalcified haploid coccolithophores. Our work also emphasizes the need for further work on the carbonate chemistry niche of the coccolithophore life cycle.},

   abstract = {Recognizing the life cycle of an organism is key to understanding its biology and ecological impact. Emiliania huxleyi is a cosmopolitan marine microalga, which displays a poorly understood biphasic sexual life cycle comprised of a calcified diploid phase and a morpho-logically distinct biflagellate haploid phase. Diploid cells (2N) form large-scale blooms in the oceans, which are routinely terminated by specific lytic viruses (EhV). In contrast, haploid cells (1N) are resistant to EhV. Further evidence indicates that 1N cells may be produced during viral infection. A shift in morphology, driven by meiosis, could therefore constitute a mechanism for E. huxleyi cells to escape from EhV during blooms. This process has been metaphorically coined the 'Cheshire Cat' (CC) strategy. We tested this model in two E. hux-leyi strains using a detailed assessment of morphological and ploidy-level variations as well as expression of gene markers for meiosis and the flagellate phenotype. We showed that following the CC model, production of resistant cells was triggered during infection. This led to the rise of a new subpopulation of cells in the two strains that morphologically resembled haploid cells and were resistant to EhV. However, ploidy-level analyses indicated that the new resistant cells were diploid or aneuploid. Thus, the CC strategy in E. huxleyi appears to be a life-phase switch mechanism involving morphological remodeling that is decoupled from meiosis. Our results highlight the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity mediating complex host–virus interactions in marine phytoplankton.},

   abstract = {Life cycles of phytoplankton species have been selected over a long evolutionary history and represent a key element for our understanding of their ecology and natural history and for improving our comprehension of ocean functioning. A species can alternate in its life cycle between four distinct major phases: growth, sex, quiescence and cell death. This implies that the population of a phytoplankton species found in any particular water sample will contain cells that undergo different fates, have strong differentiation in physiology and have different functional roles even if they are genetically identical. The factors regulating transitions among the different phases are still largely unknown but have direct impacts on the ecological distribution of species and on their biogeochemical function. Focused research efforts in recent years have begun to reveal emerging patterns in the variability of phytoplankton life cycle traits. This research has relied both on careful observations in culture and at sea and on making use of new genomics- and transcriptomics-based tools. The study of phytoplankton in the context of their life cycle characteristics opens up new opportunities to address fundamental questions about the physiology and cell biology of these important organisms and creates a new evolutionary and ecological framework for defining phytoplankton functional groups.},

Their variability is compared with environmental parameters measured by the JGOFS Group at nearby BATS station during the same time period. Coccolithophores showed a pronounced seasonal variability, with the highest standing stocks (106 × 103cells 1-1) during late winter to spring and lowest during summer. Average cell density was 20 × 103cells 1-1. Emiliania huxleyi dominated in spring (up to 93 × 103cells 1-1) and Florisphaera profunda accounted for the regional subsurface cell density peak in fall (up to 68 × 10-1cells 1-1). In summer and fall, during maximum stratification, Umbellosphaera irregularis dominated near the surface and U. tenuis at 50-75 m water depth. Both species had much lower cell densities than E. huxleyi or F. profunda. The interannual variability was large, with average cell densities in 1993 only about half those of 1992. Cell densities decreased rapidly below 100 m water depth. Seasonal relative abundance changes were rather stable from year to year. Total coccolithophore (mostly E. huxleyi) cell densities were highest where light was available (upper 50 m) and increased within a few weeks after the seasonal advection of nitrate (at temperatures of 18-23°C). They remained relatively low when only phosphate increased in the upper photic zone. F. profunda peaks occurred at slightly elevated nitrate and phosphate concentrations and at moderate light intensities. U. irregularis and U. tenuis developed in nitrate-depleted waters. The optimum temperature and light ranges of U. irregularis were higher than those of U. tenuis. Among the minor taxa, Gephyrocapsa oceanica, small coccospheres, Calciosolenia spp., Ophiaster hydroideus and Syracosphaera molischii appeared to have ecological requirements similar to those of E. huxleyi. Holococcolithophores, Calcidiscus leptoporus, Ceratolithus cristatus and Helicosphaera spp. increased at lower nitrate concentrations and higher temperatures and light intensities than E. huxleyi. Population changes of Thorosphaera flabellata were similar to those of F. profunda. Discosphaera tubifera and Rhabdosphaera clavigera increased in warm waters depleted in nitrate and showed a preference for very high light intensities. Most species seem to survive at a wide range of local environmental conditions but usually at very low cell densities. Individual taxa flourished under a relatively restricted range of favourable environmental conditions. Correlations between coccolithophores and abiotic parameter variability suggest that up to 50% of the dynamics of the most abundant coccolithophore species may be driven by variability in the physical parameters, i.e. by "bottom-up" controls. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

In all, 71 plankton samples from 16 stations collected in September 1993 were analysed for their contents of living coccolithophores. Absolute abundances range from less than 400 coccospheres per litre in surface waters to 35 000 spheres per litre at intermediate water depths. From 49 identified taxa, nine species contribute significant cell numbers of more than 2000 coccospheres per litre and comprise more than 10% of the communities in at least one sample. Important species are (in approximate order of cell abundances): Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Florisphaera profunda, Oolithotus antillarum, Calciosolenia murrayi, Umbellosphaera irregularis, Emiliania huxleyi, Umbellosphaera tenuis, Calciopappus rigidus, and Algirosphaera robusta. At most profiles, a vertical succession of coccolithophore species was found. Calciosolenia murrayi and C. rigidus were restricted to surface waters, whereas high numbers of F. profunda and A. robusta occurred at depths below 40 m. The coccolithophore communities reflected the local oceanographic situation and seemed to be more dependent on mixed layer depth and nutrient availability than on temperature and salinity changes.

   abstract = {Little is known about the distribution of coccolithophores in Arctic regions, or the reasons why they are absent from certain locations but thrive in others. Factors thought to affect cocco­lithophore distribution include nutrients, salinity, temperature and light, as well as carbonate chemistry parameters. Here we present data collected in summer 2008 along a transect between the North Sea and Svalbard (Arctic). Coccolithophore abundance and diversity were measured and compared with a set of environmental variables that included macronutrients, salinity, temperature, irradiance, pH and Ωcalcite. Eighteen coccolithophore species were found in the southern North Sea where cocco­lithophores were previously thought to be absent. In the ice-covered region north of Svalbard, cocco­lithophores were scarce and dominated by the family Papposphaeraceae. A multivariate approach showed that changes in pH and mixed layer irradiance explained most of the variation in cocco­lithophore distribution and community composition (Spearman’s rS = 0.62). Differences between the Svalbard population and those from other regions were mostly explained by pH (rS = 0.45), whereas mixed layer irradiance explained most of the variation between the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Arctic water assemblages (rS = 0.40). Estimates of cell specific calcification rates showed that species composition can considerably affect community calcification. Consequently, future ocean acidification (changes in pH) and stratification due to global warming (changes in mixed layer irradiance) may influence pelagic calcification by inducing changes in the species composition of cocco­lithophore communities.},

Low fertility of water during September-October is believed to have caused the abundance of E. huxleyi and U. irregularis. It has also been observed that malformations of E. huxleyi are common during the summer monsoon upwelling period. It was also observed that the overall coccolithophorid density decreases from south to north. Higher coccolithophorid densities in the subsurface depths are attributed to suspected blooms and thermocline depth. -from Authors},

Coccolithophores in the area were relatively diverse and a total of 95 species over 3 sampling periods studied were recognized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) techniques. R-mode hierarchical cluster analysis distinguished two coccolithophore Groups (I, IIa, IIb, IIc) with different ecological preferences. Emiliania huxleyi was the most abundant species of Group I, whereas Syracosphaera spp., Rhabdosphaera spp. and holococcolithophores were prevailing in the highly diversified Group II assemblages. Biometric analysis conducted on E. huxleyi coccoliths from Aegean water column and Black Sea sediment trap samples, indicated that during autumn, NE Aegean specimens in samples under BSW influence were featured by unimodal distribution concerning the coccolith relative tube width, with values similar to those provided by the Black Sea specimens. In early spring, coccoliths in the stations with increased BSW influx displayed a bimodal pattern of relative tube width with smaller values found mostly in the surface layers, while the distribution became again unimodal and dominated by larger values within the deeper LW layers. In the summer period, the typical LW holococcolithophore species (Group II) presented low cell numbers in the surface layer (<20 m), which is their usual ecological niche in the Aegean Sea, compared to greater depths, therefore marking LW mass flowing beneath the less saline BSW surface lid. In contrast to Black Sea early summer bloom conditions, E. huxleyi was almost absent in the NE Aegean during the summer sampling period.},

   abstract = {The present study was initiated to ascertain the significance of coccolithophores as a proxy for paleoceanographic and paleoproductivity studies in the equatorial Atlantic. Data from a range of different samples, from the plankton, surface sediments as well as sediment cores are shown and compared with each other. In general, the living coccolithophores in the surface and subsurface waters show considerable variation in cell numbers and distribution patterns. Cell densities reached a maximum of up to 300 x 103coccospheres/l in the upwelling area of the equatorial Atlantic. Here, Emiliania huxleyi is the dominant species with relatively high cell numbers, whereas Umbellosphaera irregularis and Umbellosphaera tenuis are characteristic for oligotrophic surface waters. Although they are observed in high relative abundances, these species only occur in low absolute numbers. The lower photic zone is dominated by high abundances and considerable cell numbers of Florisphaera profunda. The geographical distribution pattern of coccoliths in surface sediments reflects the conditions of the overlying surface water masses. However, abundances of the oligotrophic species Umbellosphaera irregularis and Umbellosphaera tenuis are strongly diminished, causing an increase in relative abundance of the lower photic zone taxa Florisphaera profunda and Gladiolithus flabellatus. During the past 140,000 years the surface water circulation of the equatorial Atlantic has changed drastically, as can be seen from changes in the coccolithophore species composition, absolute coccolith numbers, as well as coccolith accumulation rates. Significant increases in coccolith numbers and accumulation rates is observed in the southern equatorial Atlantic during the last glacial interval (oxygen isotope stages 2-4), which we attribute to enhanced upwelling intensities and advection of cool nutrient rich waters at this site. In the western equatorial Atlantic we observe an opposite trend with decreasing numbers of coccoliths during glacial periods, which probably is caused by a deepening of the thermocline.

   abstract = {The distribution of coccolithophorid assemblages is analyzed from water samples collected in the photic zone of the middle Ionian Sea during a cruise of R/V Urania in November-December 1997. Coccolithophorids are an important phytoplankton group in the oligotrophic eastern Mediterranean, and their coccoliths make an important contribution to the sediments of this area, being also widely used for paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic reconstructions. Nevertheless, studies on extant coccolithophorids ecology and distribution in the eastern Mediterranean are limited and mostly related to surface waters: this study, even if restricted to a single period of the year, provides the first detailed analysis of species distribution throughout the photic zone, with relation to the main local physicochemical parameters. During the investigated period, the area is characterized by the presence of a surface mixed layer, reaching a depth of 25 to 90 m. Below this layer, a marked thermo- and halocline is developed. Coccolithophorids are the dominant phytoplankton group in the investigated samples and reach concentrations up to 2 × 104 coccospheres per liter of seawater. The species assemblage is that typical of the subtropical latitude, with a general high species diversity and a well-defined depth distribution. It is in fact possible to recognize an upper photic zone assemblage, dominated by E. huxleyi and characterized by higher concentration and species diversity and a lower photic zone where typically deep-living species (i.e., F. profunda, G. flabellatus) are present. These two zones are separated by a transition layer, where species of both zones are represented and new ones appear. Such vertical distribution appears to be strictly related to the local hydrology, with the zone boundaries rising and falling as a function of the location of the isotherms. In particular the first significant occurrence of F. profunda from surface to the deep photic zone corresponds with the start of the thermocline. Comparison of present plankton data with the surface sediment record, although displaying a consistent pattern of species assemblage, shows some differences in the presence and relative abundance of some species (G. oceanica): this can be related to seasonal as well as interannual variations in the pattern and intensity of surface circulation in the investigated area.},

Sampling was performed along a north-south transect (between 39°S and 65.49°S, ~ 57.3°E) during the 4th Indian Southern Ocean Expedition (between 31st January and 18th February 2010). Coccospheres and coccoliths were counted separately using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). A total of 39 taxa (including morphotypes, types and subspecies) were recorded as intact coccospheres with abundances reaching up to 750 × 103coccospheres/l. In addition, 85 taxa (including varieties, morphotypes) were counted as coccoliths reaching up to 900 × 105coccoliths/l. Emiliania huxleyi was recognized as the most abundant species, accounting for > 86% of the total coccolithophore assemblage at each station. Elevated coccolithophore diversity was observed in the subtropical zone whereas high coccolithophore abundance was observed in the Subantarctic zone. A monospecific Emiliania huxleyi assemblage was recorded within and south of the Polar frontal zone. Three assemblages were recognized based on coccolithophore abundance and diversity. The assemblage of the Agulhas Retroflection frontal zone and Subtropical zone is highly diverse (39 taxa) and can be linked to relatively warm, high saline and oligotrophic waters. The Subantarctic zone assemblage is characterized by a reduced number (thirteen) of coccolithophore taxa, whereas the Polar Frontal zone comprises a monospecific E. huxleyi assemblage (preferentially morphotypes C and B/C). Multivariate statistics indicated that regions with elevated temperature and low nutrient concentration show high coccolithophore diversity whereas regions with high nutrient concentrations and low temperature show a strongly reduced coccolithophore diversity with abundant monospecific E. huxleyi (morphotypes B/C and C) assemblages.},

Ensemble averaging is employed to investigate the interaction of vortices with the wall. In the flow visualization study, a double row vortical structure, which includes a primary vortex formed in the outer layer region and a secondary vortex induced in the inner layer region, and the vortex liftoff phenomenon are clearly observed during the development of the wall jet. The phase averaged results of the velocity measurements show that the instability leading to induction of the secondary vortex is stimulated by the primary vortex. In the early stage of wall jet transition, the inflection point of the inner layer velocity profile moves transversely from the wall surface to the inner layer region due to passage of the well-organized primary vortex in the outer layer region. The inner layer instability is thus induced and the instability wave rolls up to form the secondary vortex. Furthermore, the secondary vortex will convect downstream faster than the primary vortex, and this difference in convective speed will lead to the subsequent phenomenon of vortex lift-off from the wall surface.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: Many coccolithophores have complex life cycles with haploid and diploid stages bearing structurally different coccolith types (holococcoliths and heterococcoliths, respectively). Laboratory studies suggest that holo- and heterococcolithophores may occupy distinct ecological niches, but the potential ecological implications of the existence of haploid and diploid stages are poorly known. We present here a study of holo- and heterococcolithophore distributions in the Catalano-Balearic Sea, during 2 cruises (MESO-96, from 18 June to 3 July, and FRONTS-96, from 16 to 21 September) that covered 2 intervals of the stratification period of 1996. We define a holococcolithophore prevalence index (HOLP index), calculated for each coccolithophore-containing sample, as the percent ratio between the number of holococcolithophores and the total number of holo- and heterococcolithophores belonging to families with alternation of holo- and heterococcolithophore life stages (coccolithophores having HOL-HET life cycles; Total_HHLC). In both cruises, the distribution of holo- and heterococcolithophores and the HOLP index indicated a preference of the holococcolithophores for shallower waters and of the heteroccolithophores for deeper layers. This segregation may be linked to a differentiation of ecological niches, with the haploid holococcolithophores occupying the more oligotrophic upper layers and the diploid heterococcolithophores inhabiting relatively rich deeper waters.},

   abstract = {<p>Although coccolithophores are not as common in the Southern Ocean as they are in sub-polar waters of the North Atlantic, a few species, such as <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i>, are found during the summer months. Little is actually known about the calcite production (CP) of these communities, or how their distribution and physiology relates to environmental variables in this region. In February 2009, we made observations across Drake Passage (between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula) of coccolithophore distribution, CP, primary production, chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and macronutrient concentrations, irradiance and carbonate chemistry. Although CP represented less than 1 % of total carbon fixation, coccolithophores were widespread across Drake Passage. The B/C morphotype of <i>E. huxleyi</i> was the dominant coccolithophore, with low estimates of coccolith calcite (~ 0.01 pmol C coccolith<sup>&minus;1</sup>) from biometric measurements. Both cell-normalised calcification (0.01&ndash;0.16 pmol C cell<sup>&minus;1</sup> d<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and total CP (< 20 μmol C m<sup>&minus;3</sup> d<sup>&minus;1</sup>) were much lower than those observed in the sub-polar North Atlantic where <i>E. huxleyi</i> morphotype A is dominant. However, estimates of coccolith production rates were similar (0.1&ndash;1.2 coccoliths cell<sup>&minus;1</sup> h<sup>&minus;1</sup>) to previous measurements made in the sub-polar North Atlantic. A multivariate statistical approach found that temperature and irradiance together were best able to explain the observed variation in species distribution and abundance (Spearman's rank correlation ρ = 0.4, p < 0.01). Rates of calcification per cell and coccolith production, as well as community CP and <i>E. huxleyi</i> abundance, were all positively correlated (p < 0.05) to the strong latitudinal gradient in temperature, irradiance and calcite saturation states across Drake Passage. Broadly, our results lend support to recent suggestions that coccolithophores, especially <i>E. huxleyi</i>, are advancing pole-wards. However, our in situ observations indicate that this may owe more to sea-surface warming and increasing irradiance rather than increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p>},

   abstract = {In this study the coccolithophore compositions of 11 plankton depth stations along a N-S transect from the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre to the Subantarctic Zone were examined qualitatively and quantitatively. The lateral and vertical distribution patterns of not only the most abundant taxa but also of the morphotypes of distinct species complexes, such as Calcidiscus leptoporus, Emiliania huxleyi, and Umbellosphaera tenuis were the focus. Geographic variation among morphotypes mirrors different ecological affinities of the members of a species complex. Multivariate statistics were used to infer the relationship between a set of known environmental data and species concentrations. The results of the detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed the presence of distinct species assemblages. The Subtropical Gyre assemblage within the upper 50 m of the photic zone is mainly composed of Umbellosphaera irregularis, U. tenuis types III and IV, Discosphaera tubifera, Rhabdosphaera clavigera, S. pulchra and E. huxleyi var. corona, adapted to warm and oligotrophic conditions. In the deeper photic zone abundant Florisphaera profunda, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Oolithotus spp. are encountered, benefiting from higher nutrient concentrations in the vicinity of the nutricline. A well-defined Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ) association is clearly dominated by E. huxleyi types A and C throughout the upper 100 m of the water column. Secondary contributors in the upper photic zone are Syracosphaera spp. (mainly S. histrica, S. molischii), Michaelsarsia elegans, Ophiaster spp. and U. tenuis type II. This assemblage is associated with cooler, nutrient-rich waters. E. huxleyi type B is found deeper in the water column. Here it is accompanied by Algirosphaera robusta, G. muellerae, and S. anthos indicating a tolerance of lower light availability in environments with elevated productivity. C. leptoporus spp. leptoporus shows relatively high cell numbers in all sampled water levels throughout the STFZ. Interestingly, its coccoliths are often smaller 5 μm in lith diameter. The mean coccolithophore assemblages of a station were compared to the underlying surface sediment assemblages. For the most part, the distribution of the morphotypes is reflected in the sedimentary archive, thus proving their potential as paleoecological proxies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The biogeography of living calcareous nannoplankton for the southeastern Indian Ocean offshore of Western Australia was studied by analyzing 192 filter samples collected within the upper 200 m of the ocean at 33 stations. The cell density of total nannoplankton decreased significantly in some nearshore stations along the Western Australian coast where the Leeuwin Current flows. A total of 92 taxa were identified by SEM observation from 118 of the samples, i.e. those which had common nannoplankton and allowed the distinction between upper- and lower-photic zone floras. The most abundant taxa were classified into three main groups and two independent species based on their distribution pattern. Of the latter, Umbellosphaera irregularis is common in the shallower samples in the tropics, whilst Gephyrocapsa oceanica occurs in isolated patches. Group U taxa (Discosphaera tubifera, Rhabdosphaera clavigera var. stylifera and Umbellosphaera tenuis) occur in the shallower depths of the subtropical water. Group UL taxa, which include Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericasonii, Syracosphaera spp., Umbilicosphaera hulburtiana and various other taxa whose coccospheres are covered by holococcoliths (holococcolithophores), are common in the subtropics. Group L taxa, which are composed of Florisphaera profunda. Oolithotus antillarum, Gladiolithus flabellatus and Algirosphaera oryza, are most common in the deep water. In order to clarify the mega-trends of floral variations in the upper- and lower-photic zone communities, we obtained the following two rations. The ratio of U. irregularis to groups U + UL in the upper-photic community is positively related to temperature, whereas its relationship with salinity and water density is negative. In the lower-photic community, the ratio of group L to UL varies in the nutrient-poor environments, but is consistently high in eutrophic environments. The occurrence of G. oceanica is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity and lower water density in the upper-photic community. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Sampling was conducted during the oligotrophic phase of the monsoonal cycle. At all sites low abundance coccolithophore communities were found with surface assemblages either dominated by Gephyrocapsa oceanica or Umbellosphaera irregularis or a diverse mixture including the two named species plus Palusphaera vandelii, Ophiaster hydroideus, Syracosphaera spp. and Calciosolenia spp. with no clear dominance of a single species. Below a well defined thermocline a deep-photic community was dominated by Florisphaera profunda, but also with high abundances of Algirosphaera robusta, Gladiolithus flabellatus and Oolithotus antillarum. In the sediments only 19 taxa were found with the three species F. profunda, G. oceanica, and E. huxleyi making up more than 90% of the assemblages. The observed living communities were part of the recurrent seasonal cycle and corresponded to the environmental conditions. The sediment assemblages distinctly differ from the living communities. Alteration effects appeared to be strong but were probably not the only cause for the biases between the living communities and the sediment assemblages. The communities during ongoing upwelling also significantly contributed to and determined the sedimentary assemblage. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Coccolithophores were investigated in both numerous plankton samples and surface sediments from across the entire Nordic Seas. Cell numbers of living coccolithophore communities are consistently higher during the high-production period (summer) than during the low-production period (fall-early summer). Particularly high cell numbers are found far to the west during the high-production period. High cell densities in general are mainly caused by Emiliania huxleyi, which often dominates the communities in the eastern Norwegian Sea. In contrast, during the low-production period, many of the collected samples contain no coccolithophores. The original composition of the living communities is obscured in the surface sediment assemblages. Samples from surface sediments contain significantly fewer coccolithophore species than the living communities of the same area. The most frequently occurring species are Emiliania huxleyi and Coccolithus pelagicus. In addition, Calcidiscus leptoporus and Gephyrocapsa muellerae are regularly found in small amounts. This is remarkable since these species are rarely found in living communities. Based on the diversity and concentration of the preserved species and on the ratio change between E. huxleyi and C. pelagicus, distinct surface water masses in this area are clearly reflected.

   abstract = {This paper discusses the techniques used to sample and analyse living marine calcareous phytoplankton. The various methods are described and tested within several research projects aimed at the determination of coccolithophore cell densities in seawater. In addition, the potential advantages and drawbacks associated with the application of light and scanning electron microscopic techniques to the quantitative analysis of coccolithophores are discussed. Several tests have been carried out in order to quantify potential errors related to: (1) homogeneity of material distribution on filter membranes; (2) use of different microscopes (scanning electron microscope versus light microscope); (3) use of different filter membranes (cellulose mixed-ester membranes versus polycarbonate membranes); and (4) Utermöhl settling versus filtration method. These tests revealed that major errors in cell density calculations could result from the uneven distribution of coccolithophore specimens on a filter membrane. The error resulting from the use of a light microscope arises from its low resolution, which restricts the identification of species, especially of small coccospheres. The use of different filter membranes does not show a statistically significant difference in cell density calculations, although polycarbonate membranes can be examined much more efficiently with the scanning electron microscopy than cellulose mixed-ester membranes. The Utermöhl method, however, gives lower cell densities consistently (several times) than the filtration method. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Abstract Coccolithophores are unicellular calcifying eukaryotes with a complex life?cycle; they are important primary producers, and major drivers of global biogeochemical cycles. The majority of research on coccolithophores has been focused on open ocean waters, while the knowledge of their roles in coastal ecosystems is limited. Early 20th century studies of the Adriatic coast produced major taxonomic papers describing half of the projected diversity of coccolithophores. Afterwards, there have been only scarce records of their diversity and ecology in the Adriatic, and coastal systems in general. We aimed to assess coccolithophore diversity and species succession, and closely examine their ecological preferences in the coastal area of the northern Adriatic. We recorded coccolithophores throughout the year at 100% frequency, documented 52 taxa, abundances as high as 2.4 ? 105 cells L?1, and noted the winter domination over the phytoplankton community. Out of 52 observed coccolithophore taxa, 31 were heterococcolithophorids and 21 holococcolithophorids. Moreover, seven pairs of heterococcolith and holococcolith phases were noted, and two strategies of temporal separation of life?cycle phases were observed. We report ecological preferences of those life?cycle pairs and give in situ evidence that holo? and heterococcolith phases are widening the specie's ecological niches. This expansion allows the species to exploit a wider range of ecological conditions and enables phenotypic plasticity, important in response to changes in the environment. With this study we emphasize that coastal areas are highly productive for coccolithophore studies. Our results indicate that a shift in research effort on coccolithophores in the coastal waters is needed.},

Coccolithophores represented 10.7% of the total Utermöhl phytoplankton that were mainly dominated by small (<10 μm) flagellates and diatoms (62.2% and 24.8% of total abundances, respectively). Coccolithophore abundances obtained by polarized light microscopy analysis ranged from 0.2 to 35.3 · 104coccospheres L−1with a mean value of 5.2 · 104coccospheres L−1. A marked seasonal pattern was observed with a main peak in December–February (2.5–31.5 · 104coccospheres L−1), in correspondence of the winter mixing, mainly due to Emiliania huxleyi, and a secondary peak in May–June (0.7–15.0 · 104coccospheres L−1), coinciding with the increase of the light intensity and the beginning of the seasonal stratification, dominated by holococcolithophores and small Syracosphaera species. The most abundant taxa were E. huxleyi and holococcolithophores, followed by Acanthoica quattrospina, Syracosphaera species and other minor species. Statistical analyses recognized four distinct groups, corresponding to seasonal variations of environmental conditions. Considering the two years, some species displayed a recurrent seasonal pattern highlighting possible species-specific ecological requirements, while others showed an interannual variability probably due to local factors.},

Previously published data were combined to compare C:vol relationships in different phylogenetic protist groups, including chlorophytes, chrysophytes, prasinophytes, and prymnesiophytes. Our analysis indicated differences between the C:vol relationships available for ciliates. A new C:vol relationship for diatoms was established (pgC cell-1 = 0.288 X volume0.811). Dinoflagellates are significantly more C dense than diatoms. Except for diatoms, we found few significant differences between C: vol relationships of different phylogenetic groups. Consequently, one C: vol relationship for taxonomically diverse protist plankton excluding diatoms was determined (pgC cell-1 = 0.216 x volume0.939). In the combined data set, carbon density was not constant but decreased significantly with increasing cell volume. Using constant C:vol conversion factors for plankton over large size ranges will cause systematic errors in biomass estimates.},

   abstract = {Uncertainties about the origin of the many disequilibrium or 'vital effects' in a variety of calcifying organisms, and whether these effects are constant or variable, have hampered paleoceanographic application of carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios. Unraveling the source of these effects will improve paleoceanographic applications and may provide new information on changes in cell physiology and ecology. Culture of eight species of coccolithophorids, a dominant marine phytoplankton group, reveals a 5‰ array of disequilibrium or 'vital effects' in both the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of coccolith calcite. In moderate light and nutrient-replete cultures, oxygen isotopic fractionation and carbon isotopic fractionation correlates directly with cell division rates and correlates inversely with cell size across a range of species. However, when growth rates of a single species are increased or decreased by higher or lower light levels, ε18O is relatively invariant. Likewise, growth rate variations as a function of temperature do not influence coccolith ε18O; the slope of the ε18O vs. temperature relation in cultures of both Gephyrocapsa oceanica and Helicosphaera carteri is the same as for abiogenic carbonates. This suggests a constant, species-specific isotopic fractionation which does not vary with cell physiology. The constancy of vital effects suggests that coccolith stable isotopes will provide reliable phase for paleoceanographic reconstruction of temperature and seawater chemistry, as long as monospecific fractions are analyzed or changes in nannofossil assemblages are accounted for with species-specific correction factors. We suspect that the cell size, and its constraints on the rate of CO2 diffusion relative to C fixation, may be the first order influence on coccolith stable isotope vital effects. A quantitative model of this process may provide important constraints on mechanisms of carbon acquisition of coccolithophorids in both modern and extinct species. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

   abstract = {Recently, calcium isotope fractionation in the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi was shown to exhibit a significant temperature dependency. An important subsequent question in this context is whether the observed fractionation patterns are caused by temperature itself or related growth rate changes. In order to separate growth and calcification rate effects from direct temperature effects, batch culture experiments with the coccolithophore E. huxleyi were conducted under varying light intensities. Despite large changes in cellular growth and calcification rates, calcium isotope fractionation remained constant. Independence of calcium isotope fractionation on growth and calcification was also obtained in two additional sets of experiments in which growth rates changed in response to varying calcium concentration and seawater salinity. These experiments also showed no direct effects of calcium concentration and salinity on calcium isotope fractionation. Values for calcium isotope fractionation of E. huxleyi coccoliths fell within a range of -1.0 to -1.6 (1000 lna), confirming earlier results. This range is similar to that observed in several foraminiferal species and coccolith oozes, suggesting a rather homogeneous calcium isotopic composition in marine biogenic calcite. Our data further show that the calcium isotope fractionation does not change with changing isotopic composition of seawater. This is a basic requirement for reconstructing the calcium isotopic composition of the ocean over time. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {Over a 15-year period (1992-2007), weekly water samples were collected from the L4 time-series station in the Western English Channel and analysed for phytoplankton community structure and abundance. The data produced have been analysed to identify seasonal patterns, inter-annual variability and long-term trends in the composition of the seven main functional phytoplankton groups. Phyto-flagellates numerically dominated accounting for on average ca. 87 of the phytoplankton abundance while diatoms, Phaeocystis, coccolithophorids, dinoflagellates and ciliates contributed 13 of abundance. Distinct seasonal and inter-annual changes in the abundance and floristic composition of the functional groups were observed. Significant long-term changes in abundance showed that, over the study period, diatoms and Phaeocystis decreased while coccolithophorids, the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum and some heterotrophic dinoflagellate and ciliates increased in abundance. These changes highlight the importance of long-term observations for the understanding of natural temporal variability in plankton communities. Such shifts in the community composition at L4 could have important consequences for ecosystem function. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},
